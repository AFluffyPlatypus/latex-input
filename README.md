Input methods which use LaTeX notation for Mac OS X or Emacs

When the input method is in effect, one types LaTeX notation for
a mathematical symbol, e.g. \infty followed by SPACE.  The LaTeX is
replaced by the symbol it represents, e.g. âˆž.

LaTeX notation which cannot be rendered has no effect.  The input
method cannot make fractions, radicals, or matrices, for example.
Only LaTeX notation for which there is a Unicode character in the Basic
Multilingual Plane (i.e. with a Unicode point less than 64k) is rendered.

Mac Installation
================

Copy the file `latex.cin` to `~/Library/Input Methods` and log out
and log back in.

How to Use on Mac
=================

In

    System Preferences | Languages & Text | Input Sources

you should see a new input source called `LaTeX`.  An input source
is what Mac OS X calls an input method.  If you check the box next
to LaTeX and if you make sure that `Show Input menu in menu bar` is
checked, then you can use the menu bar to set or unset LaTeX as the
input source.

Emacs Installation
